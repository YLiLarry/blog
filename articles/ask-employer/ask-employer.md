# Interview Questions I Would Ask My Employer

<img src="head.jpg">

Dear future employer, if we meet one day, here are some questions I would ask you at the end of my interview.

* How do you feel about me? - If the answer is negative, we can skip the rest questions and save both our time.

* Will any of you (interviewers) be my supervisor or will it be someone else?

* From my performance today, what do you think might be a potential problem if I'm working with you?

* What do you think is the most important factor that makes a productive work environment?

* How can a company make a productive enviroment also enjoyable?

* How would you describe the work environment at your company?

* I am currently working with a professor on a research that I would like to continue while I'm working. 
Will it be ok if I leave work for one hour twice a week to have a reasearch meeting with my professor, and
make the hours back by coming to work early or leaving late?

* My future plan is to continue working in the same company for the of my coop terms and post graduation.
I plan to apply for permanent residency in your country, which would involve some paper work. Do you have any past experience
with other employees with the same situation?

* Currently my computer science program has a male / female student ratio of 1 / 3. 
Why in your opinion this is a phenomenon? (Is this an issue? Have your company done anything that helps address the issue?)
